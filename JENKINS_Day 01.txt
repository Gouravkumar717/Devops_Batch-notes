=> CI & CD

CI - Continuous Integration

CD - Continuous Delivery

CD - Continuous Deployment

CI ----> Continuous Integration
Netflix ----> 2020 - Jan (V1), 2020 - August (V2), 2021 - August (V3), 2022 - January (V4), 2024 - June (V5)
		     GitHub, GitHub, GitHub, GitHub
			V1 (Oldest), V2, V3, V4, V5 (Current) 	
Building the code whenever there is a requirement of code changes

CT ----> Continuous Testing
Whenever there are updates in the code, immediately the testing team should test the code


Continuous Delivery ---->
Deploying the code manually to the production environment

Continuous Deployment ----->
V1 (day 1), V2 (day 2), V3 (day 10).......monthly basis

Whenever developers makes the changes in the github repo, automatically the code has to get deployed into the webservers/VMs.

To do automation process of code deployment into the servers, we will use JENKINS

JENKINS is an automation tool.

Jenkins is also known as CI & CD tool

JENKINS
------------------
=> Jenkins is basically a CI & CD tool
=> It is a free and open source s/w
=> Jenkins was invented by Kosukha Kawaguchi in 2004. As a part of Sun Micro Systems
=> Jenkins was developed by using Java programming language
=> Jenkins was a part of Hudson Project
=> Later, oracle has owned the Hudson project and they named as Jenkins
=> Jenkins will run on Port Number 8080

Build and Deployment Process
--------------------------------------
1. Developers will write the source code
2. Testing team will test the code
3. Developers will push the code to GitHub repo

1. Take the code from repo.
2. Compile the code
3. Package the source code
4. Deploy the war file into the servers

Developers ----> Source code ----> Testing of source code ----> Keep the code in repo ----> Take the code from repo ----> Setup the cloud based infrastructure ----> Compile and package the code ----> deploy the code


Installation of Jenkins on Linux based EC2 Instance:
----------------------------------------------------------------
***********
   Part 1
***********
1. Launch and Connect to the Instance using MobaXTerm
2. Become Root User
	sudo su
	cd (You will see only IP of Instance)
	sudo yum update -y		


***********
   Part 2
***********
https://www.jenkins.io/doc/tutorials/tutorial-for-installing-jenkins-on-AWS/

3. Add Jenkins repo. to our YUM repo:
	sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo
4. Import a key-file from Jenkins-CI to enable the installation from package:
	sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key
	
	sudo yum upgrade

***********
    Part 3
***********
5. Installing Java
	sudo amazon-linux-extras install java-openjdk11 -y

	java -version

6. Install Jenkins:
	sudo yum install jenkins -y

7. Lets start, enable, and check the status of Jenkins 
	sudo systemctl enable jenkins	
	sudo systemctl start jenkins
	sudo systemctl status jenkins
	You should see Active & Running in Green Colour, which means the Jenkins Service is successfully installed.

Note: 
To remove jenkins: sudo yum remove jenkins

***********
   Part 4
***********
By default, the Jenkins tool will run on Port No. 8080
Enable Port No. 8080 for the EC2 Instance inorder to access Jenkins Tool.
Check Instance ----> Security ----> Click on link below the Security Group ----> Add Rule ----> Custom TCP, Port No. 8080 ----> Save Rules.

Access Jenkins:

	<public ip>:8080
	cat <Paste the red code visible while accessing jenkins in browser> and execute in MobaXTerm
		cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
	Copy the code visible in MobaXTerm and Paste in Notepad
		8f39e64834e34e3ba2e6b0ef55695ea0
			Paste the above code in Jenkins Browser under "Administrative Password"
	Click on "Install Suggested Plugins"
	Create First Admin User
		Provide Username, Password, Full Name, and Email
	Save and Continue
	Copy the Jenkins URL and Paste in Notepad
		http://3.135.249.138:8080/
	Save and Finish
	Start Using Jenkins
		You will see Jenkins Console

From now, we are going to create the JENKINS Jobs

What is a Jenkins job?
------------------------------
=> Jenkins job is also known as (automated) task - CI & CDeployment
=> Types of jobs in Jenkins;
	1. Freestyle projects ----> to create jobs in Jenkins, we will use the Jenkins console
	2. Pipelines ----> to create jobs in Jenkins, we will use scripts (code)

Working with freestyle projects
